# ⌨️ Typing.com AutoTyper 🤖  

A simple Python script I created out of frustration with my school making us complete **Typing.com** lessons. 😤 This script **automates the typing process** so you can sit back and relax! 🎯💨  

## 🚀 How to Run  

### 1️⃣ Install Python 🐍  
🔹 Download & install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
🔹 **Important:** Check the box **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation! ✅  

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies 📦  

```bash
pip install selenium
```  

### 3️⃣ Run the Script 🏃‍♂️💨  
🔹 Open a **terminal** or **command prompt** in the script’s directory 📂  
🔹 Run:  
```bash
python AutoTyper.py
```

🔥 Enjoy skipping those typing lessons! 🔥 Let me know if you need more details. 🗿

## Things to note

Change the directory that is in line 8 and change it the the lesson that is in line 11 that you want to skip

Another thing to note is that for some reason it thinks tab is just 5 spaces (I might fix it)
